# Coding Studies
    Data Structures and Algorithyms 
        bread n butter stuff
    Reverse Engineering
        learning c++
            essential for reverse eng
    Databases


# Coding Toolkit
    documentation tool
        useful for keeping interface information separate from code
        and up to date.
    enviroment management
        requirements.txt is not coupled to the actual enviroment
        figure out the upgrade


# Vim Config
    suss out proper commenting commands
        just one command needed for inverting
    polish syntax highlighting
        currently doing a bunch of weird shit that im not sure about, needs a polish
    writeout on unfocus
        not possible with term vim, however are alts
            apparently you can run cmd and have output redirected to nearby term?
    case insensitive searching
    cleanup vim status bar


# System Config
    Pywal support
        automation and uniform quality for sys colorschemes
    Modularisation for themes
        having i3, polybar, xcolors, etc changed from central spot
    Rofi
        replace dmenu with themed popup
        included with dunst for notifications
    i3-lock
        get custom lock screen
    maintanence
        reshuffle the config so its under the .config folder as much as possible
        separate the aliases/secrets from bashrc into a seperate file so that
        zsh and bash can use them equally
        set term emulator as enviroment variable so that i3 config can be modular
        write little scritp that pulls config from repo on startup
